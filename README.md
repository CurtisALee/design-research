# Design Research

If you’re interested in things like design best practices and cognitive psychology, I’ve salvaged a collection of posts I originally wrote for our playbook at [Leaf][leaf].

I hope to build this up over time with any useful information or resources I find, so you can always star this repo if you're interested in reading more in the future.

Also, if someone reading this would like to contribute and add an entry of their own, then feel free to reach out to see what can be done.

As I originally wrote these as part of Leaf Software, I'd like to give some credit to the director, Chris Annetts. He was very much my only proof reader, and helped add a little extra finesse where needed.
