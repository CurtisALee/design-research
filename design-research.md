### Build trust with your users by addressing their concerns

Unfamiliarity, ambiguity, or a previous bad experience are just a couple of reasons why users are often distrustful online. One way to increase their confidence is to anticipate and address potential concerns whenever you’re asking for access, permissions, or personal information.

When signing up for a mailing list for example, well-written microcopy can help reassure the user, explaining how easily they can later opt out as well as providing clarity on how their personal information is stored.

### Be concise with your writing

Microcopy should be scannable, easily understood, and have a sense of urgency that encourages the user to take action. It should also be succinct, using clear but compact writing to help intuitively guide the user with as fewer words as possible.

The text inside a button is a good example of where conciseness is key. If you’re asking the user to upload documents for example, using “Upload your documents” can be shortened to “Upload documents”, or even “Upload” if the action is already implied within the page.

### Keep your writing conversational

Language is the number one tool for communication, so it shouldn’t be something reserved for those with stronger reading skills. Simpler words and a more casual tone of voice help an interface feel friendlier and less intimidating, and a good rule of thumb is to only use language you'd say out loud; if you wouldn't speak it, don't write it.

One way you can create a conversational tone is by avoiding complex jargon so that the copy is easily understood by everyone. Complicated words not only make your product more confusing to use, but also less inclusive considering that roughly 1 in 10 people have [some form of dyslexia][dyslexia].

### Make sure buttons clearly explain what will happen next

Unclear, misleading, or generic call-to-actions such as “Click here” all cause unnecessary doubts for the user about what they can expect. Not only do unclear buttons cause uncertainty for people when deciding whether to click, but it can also cause ambiguity by giving users a chance to misinterpret what will happen when they take a certain action.

Adding products to a basket for example, allows people to save items for future consideration. Users aren’t committing to a purchase at this stage, so a button labelled “Add to cart” will clearly represent this action, whereas a label such as “Get this now” would sound like a more final action that goes against the users expectations.

### Provide clear feedback for error messages

You should clearly imply that an error has occurred along with a concise explanation if more information is needed, and offer users a proactive, actionable solution to further increase the helpfulness of the message.

If someone’s login details are incorrect for example, saying something like “Your email and password do not match” doesn’t provide any helpful feedback for the user. If you were to instead use “Your password is incorrect. Want to reset it?”, not only is the error now clear and concise, but you also provide a possible solution as well.

### Don’t let microcopy become a crutch for poor design

Users should be able to immediately understand how to use your product. If the interface is poorly designed, trying to patch the experience together with microcopy results in users becoming entirely reliant on instructions in order to complete their tasks.

If you find yourself having to use lots of words for an instruction, or resorting to using copy to explain how a feature or component works, then reconsidering the actual design will be a better option then trying to write intuitive microcopy to support your users.

### Avoid showing modals too early

Presenting a pop-up as soon as someone lands on the page can feel intrusive and demanding of attention. Users may have a specific task in mind, and presenting a pop-up too early could make them more likely to close the modal, or pay no attention to it at all if it doesn’t relate to their intended goal.

If someone is new to your product for example, allow them to familiarise themself with the page and understand what the purpose of your product is. The aim is to give people a reason to stick around, and provide real value before hitting them with a 50% discount offer before they’ve even decided if your product is useful to them.

### Keep modals relevant to the task at hand

If a user is in the middle of a task, to have a modal suddenly appear would distract them from their journey. Not only can this cause them to lose track of where they are in the content, but it can be especially annoying if the modal contains information that isn’t relevant to their task.

Unless the modal relates to what the user is doing, like confirming that they’re happy to submit a form, you should really consider the value of the information and whether or not it is important enough to warrant someone’s full attention at that time.

### Don’t use too many pop-ups

Having multiple pop-ups appear within a short period of time not only creates further obstructions for the user, but too many distractions can also overwhelm people and make your site feel cluttered and disorganised.

If you find yourself needing to use lots of overlays to convey information, you should instead look for opportunities to show the content within the page itself. Not only will the user be able to refer back to the information if needed, but you also avoid repeatedly interrupting people.

### Aim to keep content to a minimum

A modal should relate to a single area of focus, and the content should be kept to a minimum so that users can easily consume the information and make a decision quickly. If you find yourself trying to fit a lot of content into the confines of an overlay, a new page or section would probably be a better solution.

Always include a heading that clearly describes the purpose of the modal, and allow for faster decision making by limiting any calls to action to no more than two. You should also keep the copy to a minimum, helping the user scan the content faster, and also reducing the risk of the overlays height becoming so big that a scrollbar is required.

### Always present a clear close option

An annoying modal is one thing, but when it’s not immediately obvious how to close it, the frustration factor can increase as users have to then spend time figuring out how to get rid of the modal before they can continue with their task.

As well as having a clear close option, both the escape button and surrounding space of the modal should be clickable, allowing users to dismiss the overlay and return to their task as quickly as possible.

### Consider the value of the modal

The content of the modal should be highly relevant to the user's task, and provide additional support to help move people along in their journey. For information that isn’t important, using a modal is distracting, and can leave people feeling annoyed and more likely to abandon what they’re doing.

If you’re asking a user to subscribe to your mailing list for example, consider a more passive approach, like placing a section at the bottom of the page that asks them for their email address once they've finished reading one of your blog posts. Not only will you avoid obscuring the content, but you won’t come across as being pushy either.

## Microinteractions

- [More on microinteractions](#more-on-microinteractions)

A microinteraction indicates that something is happening on screen in response to either a user action, or a system trigger such as a push notification. Despite being subtle, microinteractions can have a big impact on usability. Not only do they reassure users that their actions have had an effect, but they also create a more engaging experience.

### Consider the purpose of the microinteraction

Microinteractions should only be used when it’s clear they will benefit the user, and provide purposeful reassurance such as highlighting something they’ve entered as invalid. If it isn’t clear that a microinteraction will make the user’s task easier, then you may run the risk of confusing people rather than helping them.

When designing a form for example, you can use microinteractions for inline validation such as checking if an email address format is correct, or whether a reconfirmed password matches. By providing relevant and real-time validation, you give people immediate reassurance instead of greeting them with an error when they try to move onto the next step.

### Keep the interaction simple

Similar to being purposeful, microinteractions should also require minimal effort from the user in order for them to understand what is happening. If you aren’t able to clearly communicate to users what is taking place on screen, you run the risk of leaving people unsure about what the interface is telling them.

With inline validations for example, the presence of a checkmark would be enough to quickly confirm that the information is valid. Not only that, but the simplicity of the microinteraction means it avoids becoming annoying or distracting to the user.

### Encourage people to use your product

A product should be easy to use, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be enjoyable for people and keep them engaged through fun and meaningful microinteractions. These tiny details can create a more memorable experience that encourages people to continue using your product.

If you’re designing a to-do list for example, you could add a subtle effect such as a confetti explosion when a task is marked as complete. The actual interaction would remain clear and functional, but the extra attention to detail would make the experience feel fun and unique, leaving a more lasting impression on your users.

### Be consistent with the branding

Every element or feature on a page, including microinteractions, should look and feel like they are part of the same brand. Without consistency, the microinteractions will feel out of place from the rest of your product.

If your branding is fun and geared towards creating enjoyable experiences for example, you could use more creative animations such as a donut themed loading spinner when refreshing the page. If your brand has a more corporate identity however, then dial back on the adventurous animations in order to match a more professional tone.

### Use what’s available

Using what’s available means you don’t add more components than is necessary to feedback information. Although budget and time constraints should be considered, if you do have the scope to be more intricate with your microinteractions, you should definitely aim to reuse elements where possible to create a more seamless interaction.

A ‘Submit’ button that transitions into a loading bar for example, shows that the action has had an effect, and also creates a more connected experience that doesn’t require the use of multiple components or seperate screens to confirm that an action has taken place.

### Create microinteractions with longevity in mind

Microinteractions should be equally helpful or enjoyable every time the user interacts with them. This ties into keeping microinteractions both simple in terms of animation, and purposeful for the context in which the microinteraction is needed. Will people still find value in the interaction after the 100th time they see it? Will the interaction become more frustrating than fun over time?

Making sure the microinteractions provide value at all times is important, but you also don’t want to end up annoying your users either. A menu that bounces in with a spring may look impressive at first, but when someone needs to use that menu regularly for work, is it really better than having no animation at all?

### Include text labels where necessary

Unless an icon is universally recognised (e.g. a house to represent the homepage), its meaning may not be immediately clear without an associated label that describes the icon in plain text. When someone has to work to interpret an icon, you run the risk of not only slowing them down, but leaving them feeling less in control.

For icons that aren’t as well recognised or understood, make sure to include a label that clearly describes the icon’s meaning, and avoid hiding the label behind a hover action so that there’s no risk of users missing it. As well as better communicating meaning, a label will also create a larger click/tap area where the icon is used as part of a link.

### Keep it simple and avoid lots of detail

Icons should be easily scannable, and easily remembered. Too much detail can actually slow users down, and hinder their ability to recognise an icon's meaning quickly. More complicated icons can also make it harder for people, especially first-time users, to understand what an icon represents when interacting with it.

Be sure to minimise the amount of detail in the icon, and focus on the most important and recognisable elements of the object or action you’re representing. If you’re creating a home icon for example, square walls and a triangular roof will be much easier to understand at a glance.

### Maintain a consistent style in your icon set

Inconsistent icon styles can quickly make a design feel unbalanced and disorganised. When using icons within close proximity of one another, make sure that their weight, colour, and general form are consistent across all of the assets.

When using an icon set, or creating one from scratch, make sure that every icon looks and feels like it’s from the same gene pool. This means using the same stroke widths, colour palette, and attributes the set collectively share.

### Favour optical over mathematical alignment

An icon may be perfectly aligned, but the more abstract a shape becomes, the harder it is for our brains to process the alignment properly. This tends to be more noticeable if the icon has prominent variations in weight, such as the left side of a play button being taller, and thus heavier than the right side.

You should always favour your own instincts and align optically if you’re unsure, as any imbalances, no matter how small, can have an impact on our perception of the icons alignment. By creating an icon that appears to be perfectly aligned, they will feel more premium and balanced, and also work better for your users natural perception.

### Design with size and structure in mind

Icons that are designed at one scale but used at another may suffer from alignment or distortion issues when they’re resized. These problems can make it harder for users to understand what the icon represents, and ruin the aesthetic of both the icon and the product as a whole.

Always design your icons for the size they will be used at, and where possible, use a grid system to maintain a level of structure and consistency across the set. Not only will your icons feel more harmonious overall, but you’ll make it easier to create new icons in the future if the scale and grid template are already in place.

### Use an icon set that suits your brand personality

Icons can help embed your brand's identity into the product, showing customers that you care about the small details, and even enhancing brand recognition if your icons are particularly distinctive. Icons that are off-brand can make the experience feel inconsistent, and potentially confuse users if they feel like they shouldn’t be a part of the overall experience.

Try to use colours and styles that match the tone of your brand, like simple flat icons for corporate organisations, or playful illustrations for the more creative brands. When done right, you can bring your brand’s personality to life in unique and interesting ways, whilst also helping to enhance the aesthetic appeal of your product.

### Remember the 5 second rule

If it takes you longer than 5 seconds to think of an icon, it probably means the action or instruction you’re trying to represent can’t clearly be expressed visually alone.

When deciding whether to use icons, make sure you research your competitors beforehand to see what kind of icons they are using. Through this research, you’ll be able to determine whether or not an icon is the best approach, and what the alternatives are if not.

### Organise your content into smaller groups

According to Miller’s Law, most people can only hold around 5 to 9 items in their short-term memory. Presenting users with long lists of content makes it harder for them to keep track of the information and remember it effectively.

If you’re working with written content for example, you can create clear visual hierarchies with headings and subheadings, and use short paragraphs with white space to separate them. By breaking content into smaller groups, it helps the user scan the information faster and recall what they’ve read more accurately.

### Only show additional features if the user asks for them

Progressive Disclosure shows the most important or common features first, and hides more advanced and secondary actions unless the user requests them. Deferring rarely used or advanced features makes applications easier to learn, and allows people to prioritise their attention on the more common or easier tasks.

A settings page is a great example of showing advanced options when requested. Instead of presenting all of the controls at once, you should only display the key settings that will benefit all users. This helps less experienced users avoid mistakes, and means they don’t have to spend time trying to understand features they don’t need.

- https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/
- https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/progressive-disclosure

### Position key items at the top and bottom of a section

When viewing an unfamiliar list, we tend to remember the first and last items better than the items in the middle. This is known as the serial position effect, and is caused by the way in which our long and short-term memory stores new information.

Product pages are a good example of where this effect can be applied. You can help cement the key information in the users long-term memory by including the benefits of buying at the top of the page. You can also help the users short-term memory and decision making by placing the actionable purchase options at the bottom.

### Limit the number of choices you present to a user

Hick’s law states that the more choices you offer someone, the longer it takes them to reach a decision. Too many options cause people to overthink their decision, increasing the likelihood of them not choosing anything at all.

If you’re dealing with a navigation that has lots of links for example, presenting all of the links at once could become overwhelming for the user. Instead, aim to categorise the links into smaller parent groups to help users find the choices they need much faster.

### Increase the chance of important items being noticed first

The Von Restorff effect explains how we can isolate an object to make it stand out against other, similar objects. By creating a visual contrast using size, shape, or colour, the object is more likely to be noticed first and remembered for longer.

Highlighting a recommended subscription plan is a good example of using visual differences to increase the focus on one option over the others. Design cues such as a contrasting border or recommended banner (e.g. Most popular), help increase the chance of users noticing the preferred plan first.

- https://lawsofux.com/von-restorff-effect

### Make sure to include all relevant information

The ambiguity effect is when people view missing or unclear information negatively, which can impact the users' trust in your brand and make them less likely to continue using your product.

Clearly explain what your links and call to actions do, and avoid writing vague instructions or copy that could be open to more than one meaning. Being completely up-front about your intentions and what the user can expect means they don’t become confused or make a mistake.

- https://medium.com/@michaelgearon/cognitive-biases-ambiguity-effect-e0fe2c213061

### Offer suggestions for faster decision making

The default effect shows that making an option the default choice increases the chance that someone will stick with that option. Defaults can be a recommended option that predict the user's intention based on common choices, and help them understand what the expected action normally is.

If a user is entering their payment details in a checkout flow for example, you can look for opportunities to reuse previously entered information such as defaulting the payment address to match the shipping address. You could also pre-select an option such as the delivery cost. Users often scan the choices available, and if a suggested choice has already been made, users will be less inclined to decide against it.

- [More on ethics](#more-on-ethics)

### Give users full control over how they share their data

Not only should sharing data be something that’s entirely at the user's discretion, but companies should never leave a user feeling suspicious by asking for personal information without a reason as to why it’s necessary.

When getting a user to sign up to a mailing list for example, make sure to explicitly ask for their consent as well as explain why the information is needed. You should also give reassurance that the details will be kept private, and that consent can be removed at any time.

### Always be transparent about additional costs

Additional costs have always existed, but it becomes unethical when companies lead the user into thinking they’ll be paying less for a product by not showing any additional prices at the start of the process.

When creating a checkout flow for example, every cost including VAT and shipping should be visible as early as the basket. This allows users to make a more informed decision about continuing, and doesn’t give them any negative surprises at the end once they’ve already invested their time and effort into the process.

### Never deliberately trick or mislead users

Misleading users can potentially cause them to lose trust in your company and feel suspicious of how you operate. This can be through unclear instructions or calls to action that deliberately trick people into doing something, purely for the needs of the business as opposed to the user.

A checkbox that asks if the user would like to receive marketing emails for example, should require the user to check the box in order to consent. Having them check the box to opt out goes against the normal expectation, and means they may accidentally agree without realising.

### Consider the value of default options

Users tend to trust suggestions as they believe you have their best interests at heart. Although this can speed up decision making, companies can also take advantage of the psychology behind sticking with defaults because users trust that we want what’s best for them.

When automatically defaulting a subscription plan for example, make sure that the recommended option is truly the most appropriate for the majority of users. As soon as you default an option purely for the benefit of the business, you’re unethically placing your own goals above the needs of the user.

### Don’t persuade users to do something that benefits only you

Persuasive design is good for encouraging users to do something, but it can also be used to tempt users to perform an action simply because it stands out as being correct, regardless of whether it truly benefits them.

If you’re asking someone if they’d like to consent to sharing their data for example, both the agree and disagree options should hold equal weight to remove any bias towards one option. This isn’t the same as an action that affects only the user though, such as confirming whether someone really wants to delete a file by making the ‘Delete’ button red for example.

### Respect your users and their choices

Deliberately making a user feel bad in an attempt to change their mind or get them to do something can often have the opposite effect, leaving them feeling annoyed, guilty, and potentially hesitant to continue using your product.

An example would be asking a user if they’d like to keep up with daily health tips, with the decline option being “No, I don’t want to be healthy”. Make sure to list the benefits clearly, but don’t try and force them into making a decision. A simple “No thanks” is enough to allow the user to decline without the added guilt of saying no or feeling like they're missing out.

### Be mindful of addictive design patterns

Infinite scroll, push notifications, and autoplay are just a few features that can drive addiction. Although these patterns are intended to improve the user experience, they can form addictive behaviors that designers should be aware of.

When thinking about push notifications for example, make sure to really consider the value of the notification, and give people full control over how they receive alerts. By offering users a way to customise their notifications, such as what they receive and when, you encourage them to minimise distractions and reduce the urge to routinely check their phone.

### Plan your research objectives in advance

You must understand the reasons for carrying out your user research, and know what questions
need to be answered. Why are you carrying out this research? What are you hoping to learn
more about? By having clear objectives for your research, you can then begin working out a
plan to help you answer these questions and capture the most useful information.

If you want to find out more about your users, such as their lifestyle and demographics, then
think about the kinds of questions you’d like to ask (e.g. How often do you use apps to track
your exercise?). You can then use these questions as a guide to keep the conversation in-line
with your original objectives.

### Understand your audience and their needs

Every decision should be made with the user in mind. We must know exactly who we’re
designing for, and what their reasons are for using the product. Without this understanding, you
run the risk of designing based only on assumptions and guesswork as opposed to what your
users actually need, so make sure you’re asking questions such as:

- Who are we designing for?
- What is important to the user?
- How does the user think and behave?
- In what environment will the product be used the most?
- What device will the product mainly be used on?

Knowing exactly how people use your product, and what they want from it, means you'll be able
to make more informed design decisions that effectively meet the needs of your users.

### Research and analyse your competitors

Researching your competitors is about seeing where their strengths and weaknesses lie in
comparison to your product or service. By understanding how your competitors meet the needs
of their users, you'll be better able to strategise updates to not only compete within the target
market, but even find ways to innovate or improve on what others are doing.

To carry out your competitor analysis, make sure to assess the key areas of your product you
want to improve, and choose no more than six competitors to research. You should be looking
for the main differences they have that add value to their business, as well as ways in which
they have solved any of the problems also identified in your product.

When analysing your findings, make sure to document what you liked and disliked about each
of their products along with suggestions on how you can improve your own. Not only will you
learn more about what’s currently in use, but through regular analysis, you’ll be better able to
plan your updates effectively so that your product is meeting the expectations of your users.

### Determine what user research methods to use

At its core, the process of user research is categorised into understanding the attitude and
opinions of your users, as well as their behavior and the way in which they interact with your
product. These types of user research depend on the stage of the design journey you’re in, and
understanding what methods to use is key to making sure you’re getting the best results.

If you’re finding out more about your audience for example, then user interviews and surveys
will work best for gaining an idea of people’s opinions and beliefs. If you’re in the process of
testing your product though, then prototypes and usability testing will be the most useful in
helping you understand how people interact with your product.

Here’s a breakdown of some of the most common user research methods, and how they can
help you at various stages of a project:

#### Stakeholder interviews

Before interviewing your users and thinking about design solutions, you should first conduct
one-one-one interviews with the people (stakeholders) involved in creating the product. Not only
do these interviews establish the goals of the business and the product as a whole, but they
help align your team and give everyone a shared vision for what the end product will look like.

Just as importantly as understanding the business goals, an effective stakeholder interview
should also highlight any time and budget constraints that may disrupt the project, as well as
any issues already identified in the product.

Another useful tip for conducting a stakeholder interview is to record the session rather than
take notes. Not only will this help you focus on the conversation without breaking the flow to
write stuff down, but having a recording creates an accurate reference for you and your team to
refer back to throughout the project.

#### User interviews

User interviews are one-on-one sessions in which you ask someone a series of questions, such
as their opinion towards a design or their usage habits and the expectations they’d have of the
product. These interviews aren’t just about what the user likes, but more about learning what
they’re trying to do and seeing what isn’t working for them currently.

When carrying out a user interview, make sure you know exactly what topics you’d like to
discuss and learn more about beforehand. Once you understand the learning objectives of the
interview, you should then prepare a series of questions to help guide the conversation.

A few more tips for getting the most out of a user interview:

**Ask open-ended questions:** Make sure to ask the user open-ended questions that enable
people to expand on their thoughts and give a more in-depth answer, rather than a simple yes
or no response.

**Avoid leading the questions:** Don’t hint at a specific answer or mention what other users
responded with. By leading the question, you may inherently sway someone into answering a
certain way rather than letting them think about the question from a neutral perspective.

#### Surveys

Surveys are a great way to gather information from many users without having to interview them
directly. Surveys can also be used at any stage of a project to help teams test and validate their
designs, as well as progressively improve their product and respond to the user’s needs.

Make sure to keep the survey as short and simple as possible, and use a progress indicator to
inform the user of how long is left. If the time and effort needed to complete the survey is
minimal, then people may be more willing to take time out of the day to respond rather than use
up their valuable minutes when they could be doing something else.

As well as respecting your users time with shorter surveys, you should also make sure to target
your surveys at the right moment. If a user completes a purchase for example, then asking how
their experience was as soon as the order is confirmed will warrant a much more accurate
response while the details are still fresh in their mind.

#### Personas

These are profiles of your typical or ideal user, and are created using the information gathered
through researching your users and learning about their habits. A persona may be fictional, but
the data used to create them is real, and forms a blueprint of your user so that you get a sense
of where your product would fit into their day-to-day life.

The goal of a persona is to help you emphasise with the user, and put yourself in their shoes to
understand what motivates them, what problems they face, and what matters most to them
when using your product. Here’s a few examples of what you can uncover:

- How old are they? (e.g. Will a user in their 20s be likelier to use the more advanced
  features than someone in their 60s?).
- Where do they live? (e.g. Is the internet connection there strong, or are they likely to be
  limited on what they can use due to a slower connection?).
- What are their motivations for using the product? (e.g. Are they looking to break a
  marathon record or simply track a Sunday afternoon workout?).

#### User flows

A user flow is a diagram of the complete path someone will take when using your product.
Understanding how someone will move through the product from start to finish means you will
be able to see exactly what pages and elements they will encounter (e.g Button links), and what
sort of actions the user will need to take in order to complete their end goal.

When creating a user flow, the key steps you should be thinking about are the initial entry point,
which is the beginning of the users journey; the steps to completion, which is the path the user
takes in order to complete their task; and the final interaction, which is the point in the flow
where the user accomplishes their desired goal.

User flows should be created in the early stages of a project once you’ve collected your data
from other methods such as user interviews and surveys. These diagrams form the foundation on which your product will be built on, so it’s better to understand how users will expect the
product to work so that you can determine what type of flow would be best.

#### Card Sorting

Card sorting is about seeing how your users organise content in a way that makes the most
sense to them. Your goal is to identify patterns in the way people think about categorising the
items on your site, and avoid working off assumptions about how users search for information.

When conducting a card sorting exercise, you should aim to include between 40 and 80 items
that relate to the main content in your product (e.g. A list of products you sell), and have users
organise the items into groups. Don’t help the user or give them any hints either, as the goal of
the exercise is to see how people arrange the items in a way that’s logical to them.

You should also repeat the card sorting exercise with around 15 to 20 users, so that you collect
a large enough pool of data to help you spot any recurring patterns in people’s thinking.

#### Prototyping

A prototype is an earlier version of the product or feature you’re building, and is useful for
making sure the proposed solution truly benefits the user. With prototypes, you can gather
feedback and make adjustments on the go instead of commiting time and money into creating
something that isn’t fit for purpose.

The details and complexity of the prototype, known as the fidelity, also depends on the stage of
the project you’re in:

**Low-fidelity:** Early prototypes tend to be more paper-based, with the goal being to evolve your
ideas into something that represents the product you’re building. Paper prototypes are good for
quickly outlining a flow or user interaction, however they don't give a realistic feel for the final
product as they aren’t clickable or as well-designed.

**High-fidelity:** These are more advanced prototypes that should typically be created further
along in the design process, once it’s clear how the final product will look and function.
High-fidelity prototypes are great for giving users a more aesthetically pleasing design, and also
providing them with functionality that is closer to the end product.

#### Usability tests

Usability tests are a great way for you to observe how your users interact with a product, and
identify any pain points or areas of confusion they experience during a task.

The Nielsen Norman Group recommends finding no more than eight people to take part in
usability studies, to not only keep your costs down, but also make it easier to organise the data.
Your users should ideally fall within your target audience as well, as their feedback stands a
better chance of being the most useful if they’re also likely to use your product in real life.

During any usability test, try to keep the environment as realistic as possible, and avoid helping
the users too much. The goal is to see how people naturally solve problems, and observe their
behaviour in response to the product as if it was in the real world. By doing this, you’ll remove
any biases and get a truer sense of where your thinking can be improved.

#### A/B testing

The goal of A/B testing is to assess how users respond to two variations of a page or feature,
and analyse how either version performs. By splitting a design into two versions (A or B), you
can see how the changes affect the users behaviour, and determine whether a proposed update
or design change is worth pursuing further.

Before conducting an A/B test, you first need to decide why you’re doing it. Is it to increase the
number of registrations, or reduce the amount of users abandoning the checkout for example?
Having a goal gives you a metric to measure the test against, so that you can see whether your
proposed changes really do improve the product and solve the issues identified.

To conduct the actual A/B test, you need to split the users accessing your product into two
groups, with either group viewing one or the other version of the proposed design. A great tool
to run these tests is [Google Experiments][google ex], which allows you to specify the page and the changes you’d like to compare, as well as monitor the results from real users.

### Organise the data gathered in your research

Organising your research is about adding structure to the data you collected, categorising the
information, and making it easier to look for any recurring problems reported by your users.
Without proper organisation, it can become harder for you to work out what issues to prioritise
and see where to focus your attention.

Using tags is a good example of organising your research. Tags involve grouping similar
findings into more manageable chunks, such as any issues involving navigation on the site.
These groups are often colour coded, and are categorised under labels such as ‘navigation’ so
that you’re able to identify common themes and see where the main problems are.

### Analyse the data before making any decisions

Once you’ve collected the research and identified where the issues are in your product, your
next step is to analyse the data to understand exactly what it means, and begin thinking of ways
in which you can solve the problems uncovered.

- Where are the issues occurring, and why?
- What does the data tell you about your users?
- Which changes will have the biggest impact?

Without proper analysis, you risk making changes based solely on what the numbers are telling
you (e.g. 50% of users abandon the cart), instead of really understanding what the core issue is.
This can lead to teams making impulsive decisions, by trying to solve the problem before
they’ve really taken the time to understand what’s causing the user issues in the first place.

If half of your users are abandoning their cart for example, you might consider redesigning the
checkout, but this may not necessarily solve the actual problem. Through proper analysis
however, you may for example find that users feel as though they’re being forced to sign up first,
meaning an effective solution could be to provide a guest checkout option instead.

### Share your insights and recommendations

On any project, it's essential that each stakeholder understands the problems at hand, and
sharing your research helps others make sense of your findings and see where the issues are in
your product. Your aim is to ensure that everyone involved in the product is aligned on the
needs of the user so that they can collectively work towards a single, shared goal.

A good approach to sharing your findings is to create a research report. Not only are reports
easily shareable with your team no matter where they are, but it also means people can refer to
the original document at any time to make sure their thinking remains on track, and that they
don’t accidentally miss-remember the information or work off of best guesses.

When creating your report, make sure you explain the objectives that led the research, as well
as your findings and recommendations for solving the issues uncovered. As well as including enough detail in the report for all stakeholders to understand, screenshots and other visual
materials will also make your report more appealing to read as opposed to just walls of text.

### Gather user feedback through regular testing

Prototypes and usability testing are great ways to identify where the pain-points are for users,
as well as gather feedback and opinions to help move your designs along. Without consistent
testing, it’s easy to miss opportunities to improve your thinking, or worse, spend a lot of time
designing something that isn’t fit for purpose.
